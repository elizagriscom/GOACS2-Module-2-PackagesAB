# GOACS2 Python Modules and Packages


## PYTHON MODULES

In this assignment, you will import a **Python package** to help you run some sets of sample code.

Instructions for importing packages are below. The most important steps are <ins>underlined</ins>.


> ### WINDOWS
> 1. <ins>Open the Terminal</ins>
>     * At the top of the VSCode window, you'll see the Terminal menu in the menu bar. 
Choose `New Terminal` from the menu, or use the shortcut `Ctrl` + `Shift` + \`
> 2. Create a virtual environment
>     * <ins>In the Terminal, type `Python -m venv venv`</ins>
>         * This creates a new folder called `venv`
>         * The purpose of this folder is to have only the Python modules we need in our program.
> 3. Activate the virtual environment
>     * <ins>In the Terminal, type `Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy remoteSigned -Scope Process`</ins>
>         * This gives our program permission to install modules in the virtual environment
>     * <ins>In the Terminal, type `.\venv\Scripts\activate`
>         * You'll see that the Terminal prompt changes to include `(venv)` at the beginning of the prompt. That's how you know you're in the right environment.
> 4. Install the required package(s)
>     * <ins>In the Terminal, type `pip install bokeh`</ins>
>     * Bokeh is the package used for this visualization
> 5. Run the program
>     * Select the sample.py file in the explorer
>         * If you don't see the file list, click on the icon on the top left of the window
>     * Click the play button on the top right of the window


> ### MACOS
> 1. <ins>Open the Terminal</ins>
>     * In the menu bar at the top of your screen, you'should see the Terminal menu. Choose `New Terminal` from the menu, or use the shortcut `Ctrl` + `Shift` + \`
> 2. Create a virtual environment
>     * <ins>In the Terminal, type `python3 -m venv venv`</ins>
>         * This creates a new folder called `venv`
>         * The purpose of this folder is to have only the Python modules we need in our program.
> 3. Activate the virtual environment
>     * <ins>In the Terminal, type `venv/bin/activate`
>         * You'll see that the Terminal prompt changes to include `(venv)` at the beginning of the prompt. That's how you know you're in the right environment.
> 4. Install the required package(s)
>     * <ins>In the Terminal, type `pip install bokeh`</ins>
>     * Bokeh is the package used for this visualization
> 5. Run the program
>     * Select the sample.py file in the explorer
>         * If you don't see the file list, click on the icon on the top left of the window
>     * Click the play button on the top right of the window
